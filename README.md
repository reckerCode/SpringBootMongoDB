Spring Boot integration with mongoDB

MongoDB and Spring Boot interact using the 
MongoTemplate class and MongoRepository interface.

Mongo Template: Implements a set of ready-to-use APIs. A good choice for
operations like update, aggregations, and other, MongoTemplate offers 
finer control over custom queries.

Mongo Repository: Mongo repository is used for basic queries
that involve all or many field of the document. Examples include
data creation, viewing documents and more.
